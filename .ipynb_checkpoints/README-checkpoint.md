# Fitness-Watch-Data-Analysis
Fitness Watch Data Analysis is a crucial tool for businesses in the health and wellness domain. By analyzing user data from fitness wearables, companies can understand user behaviour, offer personalized solutions, and contribute to improving usersâ€™ overall health and well-being.

## Dataset
    Date: The date when the data was recorded.
    Time: The time at which the data was recorded.
    Step Count: The number of steps taken during the recorded interval.
    Distance: The distance covered in meters during the recorded interval.
    Energy Burned: The amount of energy burned in kilocalories during the recorded interval.
    Flights Climbed: The number of flights of stairs climbed during the recorded interval.
    Walking Double Support Percentage: The percentage of time both feet are in contact with the ground while walking.
    Walking Speed: The walking speed in meters per second during the recorded interval.

## Tasks Performed
    Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution, trends, and patterns of each fitness metric.
    Create visualizations to depict how different metrics vary over time, across different time intervals, or in relation to one another.
    Analyze how step count, distance, energy burned, and other metrics correlate with each other.
    Identify potential patterns in walking efficiency, energy expenditure, and the relationship between step count and walking speed.
    Segment the data into time intervals (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening) based on the recorded timestamps.
    Investigate variations in fitness metrics (e.g., step count, walking speed) during different time intervals.
